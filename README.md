# freeCodeCamp-pomodoro

this project was made to clone the classical studying app, as know as the 25-5 minute study rule, where you study for 25 minutes and then take a break for 5 minutes.

this software is made to track the time for this method, with alarming sounds to tell the user when is the time for the required break.

both the study and break time can be adjusted in this application.
